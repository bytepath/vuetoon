features:
- title: Built For Web Developers
  details: Bytepath has been designed to be used by web developers and makes the assumption that you have no experience with computer graphics.
- title: Powered By Vue.js
  details: BytePath is built on top of Vue.js. The same skills you've perfected to make awesome websites can now be used to create computer graphics. Anything you can do in vue, you can do here (slots, $emit, Mouse/Keyboard Events, props, mixins, etc) 
- title: Component Based
  details: Bytepath Assets are single file Vue.js components allowing you to store your art, code, and animations in a single reusable module. Create new assets by composing assets together like "Russian Nesting Dolls" 
- title: Super Simple Vector Graphics
  details: Rotate, Scale, and reposition on screen graphics by modifying prop values. Art assets will automatically redraw after any change of position
- title: Reactive Animations
  details: Animate scenes with dead simple javascript objects you already know how to write. Animations will automatically update when the :keyframe prop of a component changes 
- title: Compatible With Professional Creative Tools
  details: Bytepath assets are SVG files you create using the professional tools you know and love (Illustrator, Affinity Designer, Inkscape, etc) No art skills? Use NPM, Yarn, etc to install community made assets that you can re-purpose for use in your own projects. 
- title: Responsive 
  details: Bytepath provides tools to help you provide a great experience with any device.   
- title: Zero CSS
  details: Bytepath graphics and animation are built entirely using Javascript. No CSS required whatsoever (Unless you want to!)
